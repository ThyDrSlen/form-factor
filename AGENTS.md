# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Source screens live in `app/` using Expo Router segments; shared UI is in `components/` and `design-system/`. Cross-cutting state providers sit under `contexts/`, while reusable logic hooks live in `hooks/`. Business logic, API helpers, and utilities are collected in `lib/`. Native modules, including custom ARKit pieces, are organized under `native/` with platform-specific code in `ios/` and `android/`. Assets such as fonts, icons, and media are stored in `assets/`. End-to-end tests reside in `tests/e2e/`, and automation utilities live in `scripts/`. Consult `docs/` for ARKit setup and build guidance before touching native code.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install dependencies with `bun install`. Run the Expo dev server via `bun run start`; use `bun run start:devclient` when targeting the custom development client. Launch native builds with `bun run ios` or `bun run android`, and the web preview with `bun run web`. Execute linting checks through `bun run lint`. End-to-end tests run with `bunx playwright test`, which auto-spawns the Expo web server defined in `playwright.config.ts`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
All code is TypeScript with `strict` settings and the Expo ESLint flat config. Prefer 2-space indentation and trailing commas (Prettier-compatible). Components and hooks use PascalCase files (`NutritionCard.tsx`) except for Expo route segments, which follow folder-based naming. Use the `@/` base alias for intra-project imports instead of relative paths. Styling leans on Tailwind via NativeWind; keep utility class strings short and extract shared styles into the design system when reused.

## Testing Guidelines
Playwright drives e2e coverage; add specs in `tests/e2e/*/*.spec.ts` and model names after the flow under test (e.g., `auth.flow.spec.ts`). Tests should be independent, avoid `test.only`, and rely on fixtures instead of seeding production services. Capture traces and screenshots on failure are already configuredâ€”collect artifacts before filing bugs. When adding new UI flows, pair them with smoke-level e2e coverage and document edge cases in `PROGRESS.md`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the conventional commit style already in history (`feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). Keep commits scoped and descriptive; include native platform or package names when relevant. Pull requests need a clear summary, linked issue or ticket, and screenshots or screen recordings for UI-facing changes. Call out migrations or manual setup steps in the PR body and update relevant docs (`POSE_DETECTION_SETUP.md`, `QUICK_START.md`) when instructions change.
