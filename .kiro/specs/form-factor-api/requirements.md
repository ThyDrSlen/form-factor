# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive REST API for the Form Factor fitness application, enabling workout session management, exercise set logging, and AI-powered form analysis. The API will provide endpoints for creating workout sessions, logging individual sets with optional video analysis, and retrieving form feedback to help users improve their exercise technique.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to create and manage workout sessions, so that I can track my exercise activities over time

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a workout THEN the system SHALL create a new session with a unique ID and timestamp
2. WHEN creating a session THEN the user SHALL be able to optionally specify a workout goal (hypertrophy, strength, or endurance)
3. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL return the session details including ID, start time, and status
4. WHEN a user ends a workout THEN the system SHALL update the session status to completed and record the end time
5. WHEN a user cancels a workout THEN the system SHALL update the session status to canceled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to log individual exercise sets during my workout, so that I can track my performance and progress

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging a set THEN the user SHALL provide the session ID, exercise ID, and number of reps
2. WHEN logging a set THEN the user SHALL optionally provide weight in kilograms
3. WHEN logging a set THEN the user SHALL optionally provide a video URL for form analysis
4. WHEN a set is logged THEN the system SHALL create a unique set record with timestamp
5. WHEN a set is created THEN the system SHALL return the complete set details including generated ID

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to request AI-powered form analysis for my exercise videos, so that I can receive feedback to improve my technique

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting form analysis THEN the user SHALL provide a valid set ID
2. WHEN requesting analysis THEN the user SHALL optionally provide pose frame data if available
3. WHEN analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL create an analysis job and return job details
4. WHEN analysis is processing THEN the system SHALL return appropriate status updates
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable form cues and metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to check the status and results of my form analysis requests, so that I can receive timely feedback on my exercise technique

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking analysis status THEN the user SHALL provide a valid job ID
2. WHEN analysis is queued or processing THEN the system SHALL return the current status
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return form cues with timestamps and severity levels
4. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information
5. WHEN analysis includes metrics THEN the system SHALL provide quantitative performance data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that I can build reliable client applications

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 400 Bad Request responses
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation error messages
3. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found responses
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 Internal Server Error responses
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want my API interactions to be secure and authenticated, so that my workout data remains private and protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the user SHALL provide valid authentication credentials
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized responses
3. WHEN accessing unauthorized resources THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden responses
4. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL reject requests with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
