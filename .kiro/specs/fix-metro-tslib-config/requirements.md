# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a Metro bundler error where framer-motion cannot access the `__read` helper function from tslib. The current setup has multiple tslib shim files and complex Metro resolver configurations that are causing conflicts. This feature aims to simplify and fix the tslib configuration to resolve the bundling error while maintaining compatibility with React Native and Expo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Metro bundler to successfully resolve tslib dependencies, so that the application can build and run without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Metro bundler processes framer-motion imports THEN it SHALL successfully resolve all tslib helper functions including `__read`
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL not throw TypeErrors related to tslib functions
3. WHEN tslib is imported by any dependency THEN it SHALL provide all required helper functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and maintainable Metro configuration, so that future updates and debugging are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the Metro configuration THEN it SHALL have minimal complexity and clear purpose for each setting
2. WHEN unnecessary shim files exist THEN they SHALL be removed to reduce maintenance overhead
3. WHEN the configuration is updated THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with Expo and React Native requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper tslib compatibility across all import styles, so that both CommonJS and ESM modules work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules import tslib using CommonJS syntax THEN they SHALL receive the correct tslib functions
2. WHEN modules import tslib using ESM syntax THEN they SHALL receive the correct tslib functions with proper default export
3. WHEN framer-motion accesses tslib helpers THEN all required functions SHALL be available and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove unnecessary configuration files, so that the project structure is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate or redundant shim files exist THEN they SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN configuration files serve no purpose THEN they SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the application SHALL still function correctly
