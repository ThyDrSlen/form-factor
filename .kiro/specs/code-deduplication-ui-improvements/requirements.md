# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on identifying and planning the removal of duplicate code patterns, improving UI consistency, and enhancing the overall developer experience without making destructive changes. The goal is to create a comprehensive analysis and improvement plan that maintains functionality while reducing technical debt and improving code maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate code patterns identified and documented, so that I can understand the scope of refactoring needed without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate import patterns and authentication logic
2. WHEN duplicate code is found THEN the system SHALL document the locations and suggest consolidation strategies
3. WHEN creating refactoring plans THEN the system SHALL prioritize non-destructive changes first
4. IF destructive changes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed migration plans with rollback strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI inconsistencies identified and improvement plans created, so that the user experience is cohesive across all screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing UI components THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent styling patterns
2. WHEN analyzing navigation flows THEN the system SHALL document UX improvements needed
3. WHEN creating UI improvement plans THEN the system SHALL focus on component reusability
4. IF UI changes affect user workflows THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive feature documentation and architecture diagrams, so that new team members can quickly understand the codebase structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting features THEN the system SHALL create visual architecture diagrams
2. WHEN explaining component relationships THEN the system SHALL provide clear dependency maps
3. WHEN creating developer guides THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions and common workflows
4. IF architecture changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL document migration paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want feature enhancement plans that build upon existing functionality, so that we can improve the app without rewriting working code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning feature enhancements THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to extend existing components
2. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API contracts
3. WHEN creating enhancement roadmaps THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-facing improvements
4. IF new features are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with current architecture
