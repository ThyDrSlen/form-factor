# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses iOS build failures caused by incompatible pod versions in the React Native/Expo project. The issue occurs when different pods depend on conflicting versions of the same dependency, or when cached Podfile.lock versions don't match the required values in Podspecs of installed libraries. This fix will ensure reliable iOS builds by resolving pod dependency conflicts and implementing proper dependency management practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the iOS build to succeed without pod dependency conflicts, so that I can build and deploy the iOS app reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the iOS build is triggered THEN the system SHALL resolve all pod dependencies without version conflicts
2. WHEN pod dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility across all installed libraries
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without pod resolution errors
4. IF dependency conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper cache management for pod dependencies, so that cached versions don't cause build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pod cache becomes stale THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to clear and refresh the cache
2. WHEN Podfile.lock is cached THEN the system SHALL ensure versions match current Podspec requirements
3. IF cache-related conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and resolve them
4. WHEN dependencies are modified THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and tooling for pod dependency management, so that I can prevent and resolve conflicts efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
2. WHEN resolving conflicts THEN the system SHALL offer automated resolution options where possible
3. IF manual intervention is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear step-by-step guidance
4. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the system SHALL validate that all dependencies are properly resolved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pod dependency resolution to be maintainable, so that future updates don't reintroduce similar conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility before integration
2. WHEN existing dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL check for potential conflicts
3. IF version constraints need adjustment THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations
4. WHEN the project is set up on new environments THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent dependency resolution
