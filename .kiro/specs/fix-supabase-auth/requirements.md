# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Supabase authentication system is currently experiencing issues that prevent users from successfully signing in and maintaining authenticated sessions. This feature addresses critical authentication problems including OAuth flow handling, session management, environment configuration, and callback URL processing to ensure reliable user authentication across all platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with Google OAuth successfully, so that I can access the app's authenticated features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL open the Google OAuth flow in a browser
2. WHEN the OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL properly handle the callback URL with auth tokens
3. WHEN auth tokens are received THEN the system SHALL establish a valid Supabase session
4. WHEN the session is established THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the main app interface
5. IF the OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
6. WHEN the user cancels the OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL return to the sign-in screen without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to persist across app restarts, so that I don't have to sign in every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store the session securely using AsyncStorage on native platforms
2. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL check for an existing valid session
3. WHEN a valid session exists THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate the user without requiring re-login
4. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token if a refresh token is available
5. IF session refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the sign-in screen
6. WHEN the user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored session data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable configuration, so that the Supabase client is initialized correctly across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL validate that EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is properly set
2. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL validate that EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is properly set
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL throw a clear error with instructions
4. WHEN the Supabase client initializes THEN the system SHALL log the configuration status for debugging
5. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for auth state changes
6. IF environment variables are malformed THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the OAuth callback handling to work reliably, so that I can complete the authentication flow without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OAuth provider redirects back to the app THEN the system SHALL properly parse the callback URL
2. WHEN parsing the callback URL THEN the system SHALL extract access_token and refresh_token correctly
3. WHEN tokens are extracted THEN the system SHALL call supabase.auth.setSession() with the correct parameters
4. WHEN setSession succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the auth context state immediately
5. IF callback URL parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
6. WHEN handling callbacks THEN the system SHALL support both hash and query parameter formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error handling during authentication, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry options
3. WHEN Supabase service errors occur THEN the system SHALL log technical details for debugging
4. WHEN OAuth provider errors occur THEN the system SHALL translate technical errors to user-friendly messages
5. IF the user's account is not found THEN the system SHALL suggest account creation options
6. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL inform the user to wait before retrying

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive auth state management, so that the app correctly handles all authentication scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auth state changes THEN the system SHALL update the loading state appropriately
2. WHEN signing in THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to prevent multiple attempts
3. WHEN auth operations complete THEN the system SHALL clear loading states
4. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide access to user profile data
5. WHEN switching between mock and real auth THEN the system SHALL handle state transitions cleanly
6. IF auth state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL reset to a known good state
