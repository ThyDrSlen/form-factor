# Apple HIG UI Design Implementation

## Overview

This design document outlines the comprehensive implementation of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) across the PT Expo fitness social media application. The design focuses on creating a native iOS experience that leverages platform conventions while supporting the app's unique features including real-time form analysis, workout tracking, and social engagement.

The implementation will transform the current interface to fully embrace Apple's design principles, ensuring accessibility, consistency, and intuitive navigation patterns that users expect from high-quality iOS applications.

## Architecture

### Design System Foundation

**Typography System**
- Implement Dynamic Type support using Apple's text styles (Large Title, Title 1-3, Headline, Body, Caption, Footnote)
- Support accessibility text sizes (AX1, AX2, AX3) with proper scaling
- Use system fonts with appropriate weights and leading values
- Ensure text remains legible at all supported sizes

**Color System**
- Adopt semantic color system with light/dark mode support
- Use system colors for standard elements (systemBlue, systemRed, etc.)
- Implement custom brand colors with proper contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Apply appropriate vibrancy effects for content over materials

**Spacing and Layout System**
- Use consistent spacing based on 8pt grid system
- Implement safe area-aware layouts for all devices
- Support size class adaptations (compact/regular width and height)
- Ensure proper margins and padding following HIG specifications

### Navigation Architecture

**Primary Navigation Structure**
- Tab Bar Navigation: Bottom tab bar with 4-5 primary sections
  - Home/Dashboard (SF Symbol: house.fill)
  - Workouts (SF Symbol: figure.strengthtraining.traditional)
  - Social Feed (SF Symbol: person.2.fill)
  - Profile (SF Symbol: person.circle.fill)
  - More/Settings (SF Symbol: ellipsis.circle.fill)

**Secondary Navigation Patterns**
- Navigation Stack: Hierarchical drill-down navigation within tabs
- Modal Presentation: For focused tasks (add workout, camera capture)
- Sheet Presentation: For contextual actions and secondary content
- Split View: iPad-optimized layouts with sidebar navigation

**Navigation Bar Configuration**
- Large titles enabled for top-level screens
- Standard titles for detail screens
- Appropriate back button behavior with custom titles when needed
- Search integration using UISearchController where applicable

## Components and Interfaces

- Consistent color coding across all charts
- Proper axis labeling and legends
- Audio Graphs support for VoiceOver users

## Data Models

### UI State Management

**Theme and Appearance**
```swift
class ThemeManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var colorScheme: ColorScheme = .automatic
    @Published var dynamicTypeSize: DynamicTypeSize = .large
    @Published var reduceMotion: Bool = false
    @Published var increaseContrast: Bool = false
}
```

**Navigation State**
```swift
class NavigationManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var selectedTab: TabSelection = .home
    @Published var navigationPath: [NavigationDestination] = []
    @Published var presentedSheet: SheetType?
    @Published var presentedModal: ModalType?
}
```

**Accessibility State**
```swift
class AccessibilityManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isVoiceOverRunning: Bool = false
    @Published var isFullKeyboardAccessEnabled: Bool = false
    @Published var isSwitchControlRunning: Bool = false
