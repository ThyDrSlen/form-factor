# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) compliant UI design across the PT Expo fitness social media application. The goal is to create a consistent, accessible, and intuitive user experience that follows Apple's design principles while supporting the app's core features of workout tracking, form analysis, and social engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to follow Apple's design standards, so that I can navigate and interact with the interface intuitively using familiar patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the interface SHALL use Apple's standard navigation patterns including tab bars, navigation bars, and hierarchical navigation
2. WHEN users interact with controls THEN the app SHALL provide appropriate haptic feedback using UIFeedbackGenerator for notifications, impacts, and selections
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the app SHALL use Apple's standard typography scales and dynamic type support
4. WHEN users navigate between screens THEN the app SHALL use standard iOS transitions and animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the app to be fully accessible, so that I can use assistive technologies to interact with all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using VoiceOver THEN all interactive elements SHALL have appropriate accessibility labels and traits
2. WHEN Full Keyboard Access is enabled THEN all app functionality SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation
3. WHEN Reduce Motion is enabled THEN the app SHALL minimize or eliminate animations and motion effects
4. WHEN using Dynamic Type THEN all text SHALL scale appropriately and remain legible at all accessibility text sizes
5. WHEN using Switch Control THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly configured for switch navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual hierarchy and layout, so that I can easily understand the importance and relationship of different interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any screen THEN the app SHALL use consistent spacing based on Apple's layout guidelines and safe areas
2. WHEN content exceeds screen bounds THEN the app SHALL implement proper scrolling behavior using UIScrollView or SwiftUI ScrollView
3. WHEN displaying data in lists THEN the app SHALL use standard list layouts with appropriate disclosure indicators and cell accessories
4. WHEN showing hierarchical content THEN the app SHALL use proper navigation split views on iPad and appropriate layouts on iPhone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to adapt to different device sizes and orientations, so that I have an optimal experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on different devices THEN the interface SHALL adapt using size classes (compact/regular) appropriately
2. WHEN rotating the device THEN the layout SHALL adjust gracefully maintaining usability and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN using iPad THEN the app SHALL take advantage of larger screen real estate with appropriate multi-column layouts
4. WHEN using iPhone in landscape THEN critical functionality SHALL remain accessible and properly laid out

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback and clear affordances, so that I understand what elements are interactive and what actions are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements are interactive THEN they SHALL provide clear visual affordances using standard button styles and colors
2. WHEN actions are in progress THEN the app SHALL show appropriate progress indicators using ProgressView
3. WHEN displaying status information THEN the app SHALL use system-standard colors and symbols from SF Symbols
4. WHEN content has different states THEN the app SHALL use appropriate visual treatments (selected, disabled, highlighted)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to integrate seamlessly with iOS system features, so that I can use familiar gestures and interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing standard gestures THEN the app SHALL respond using system-standard behavior (swipe to delete, pull to refresh, etc.)
2. WHEN using the app THEN it SHALL respect system settings like Dark Mode, Reduce Motion, and accessibility preferences
3. WHEN displaying sheets and modals THEN the app SHALL use standard presentation styles with proper grabber visibility
4. WHEN showing contextual actions THEN the app SHALL use appropriate menus and action sheets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user tracking workouts and food, I want data visualization to follow Apple's chart design principles, so that I can easily understand my fitness progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying workout data THEN charts SHALL use Swift Charts with proper accessibility support
2. WHEN showing progress over time THEN visualizations SHALL include appropriate titles, axis labels, and descriptions
3. WHEN charts update THEN the app SHALL notify VoiceOver users of changes using accessibility notifications
4. WHEN displaying complex data THEN charts SHALL provide Audio Graphs support for accessibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the social features to use familiar interaction patterns, so that I can easily engage with the fitness community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the social feed THEN the interface SHALL use standard list or collection view layouts
2. WHEN interacting with posts THEN the app SHALL provide standard social actions (like, comment, share) with familiar iconography
3. WHEN creating content THEN the app SHALL use standard input methods and keyboard handling
4. WHEN viewing user profiles THEN the layout SHALL follow standard profile design patterns

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user using the camera for form analysis, I want the camera interface to follow Apple's design patterns, so that I feel confident using the feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the camera THEN the interface SHALL use standard camera controls and layouts
2. WHEN providing form feedback THEN visual overlays SHALL use appropriate colors (green for correct, red for needs improvement) with sufficient contrast
3. WHEN camera is active THEN the app SHALL provide clear visual indicators of recording state and available actions
4. WHEN form analysis is complete THEN feedback SHALL be presented using standard alert or sheet presentations

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent color usage throughout the app, so that I can understand the meaning of different interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying interface elements THEN the app SHALL use semantic colors that adapt to light and dark modes
2. WHEN showing status information THEN colors SHALL follow Apple's semantic color guidelines (red for destructive, blue for primary actions, etc.)
3. WHEN using brand colors THEN they SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
4. WHEN applying visual effects THEN the app SHALL use appropriate materials and vibrancy effects
