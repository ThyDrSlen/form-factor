# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-Time Form Feedback feature enables users to receive immediate visual and audio feedback on their exercise form during workouts. This feature leverages on-device computer vision to analyze body posture and movement patterns, providing color-coded overlays and audio cues to help users maintain proper form and prevent injury. This is a core differentiator for the PT Expo App that sets it apart from traditional fitness tracking applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness enthusiast, I want to receive real-time visual feedback on my exercise form, so that I can maintain proper technique and prevent injury during workouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a workout session THEN the system SHALL activate the camera and display a live video feed
2. WHEN the camera captures frames THEN the system SHALL process pose estimation on-device using MediaPipe or OpenCV
3. WHEN pose data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL overlay a skeleton visualization on the video feed
4. WHEN joint angles are within acceptable ranges THEN the system SHALL display green indicators on relevant joints
5. WHEN joint angles deviate from proper form THEN the system SHALL display red indicators on problematic joints
6. WHEN form corrections are needed THEN the system SHALL highlight specific body parts requiring adjustment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user performing exercises, I want to receive audio cues about my form, so that I can make corrections without having to constantly look at the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form deviations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide audio prompts naming specific joints or body parts
2. WHEN the user maintains good form for 3+ consecutive reps THEN the system SHALL provide positive audio reinforcement
3. WHEN critical form errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide immediate audio warnings
4. WHEN the user enables audio feedback THEN the system SHALL allow volume adjustment and mute options
5. IF the user disables audio feedback THEN the system SHALL continue visual feedback only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to calibrate the camera for my specific setup and body type, so that the form analysis is accurate for my workout environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first launches form feedback THEN the system SHALL guide them through a calibration workflow
2. WHEN calibrating THEN the system SHALL detect the user's position relative to the camera
3. WHEN calibrating THEN the system SHALL allow the user to adjust camera angle and distance recommendations
4. WHEN calibration is complete THEN the system SHALL save the user's baseline measurements and camera setup
5. WHEN the user changes workout location THEN the system SHALL offer to recalibrate
6. IF calibration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for optimal camera positioning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user tracking my fitness progress, I want my form analysis data to be saved with my workout history, so that I can review my technique improvements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workout session ends THEN the system SHALL save form score snapshots to the local database
2. WHEN form data is captured THEN the system SHALL include rep counts, duration, and average form scores
3. WHEN network connectivity is available THEN the system SHALL sync form data to Supabase
4. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL cache form data locally using Expo SQLite
5. WHEN reviewing workout history THEN the system SHALL display form improvement trends and metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with different devices and orientations, I want the form feedback to work regardless of how I position my phone, so that I have flexibility in my workout setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate pose tracking
2. WHEN using different camera positions (front/back) THEN the system SHALL adjust pose analysis accordingly
3. WHEN the device is in landscape or portrait mode THEN the system SHALL adapt the UI layout appropriately
4. WHEN lighting conditions change THEN the system SHALL maintain pose detection accuracy
5. IF pose detection confidence drops below 70% THEN the system SHALL notify the user to adjust positioning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want all form analysis to happen on my device, so that my workout videos and body data never leave my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video frames THEN the system SHALL perform all analysis locally on the device
2. WHEN form feedback is active THEN the system SHALL NOT upload video data to external servers
3. WHEN saving form metrics THEN the system SHALL only store numerical scores and joint angle data
4. WHEN syncing to Supabase THEN the system SHALL only upload aggregated form scores, not raw video or pose data
5. WHEN the user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all local form analysis data
