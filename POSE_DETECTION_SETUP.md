# ðŸŽ¯ How to Add VisionPoseDetector Files to Xcode

## âœ… Xcode is now open!

### **Step 1: Add the Files**
1. **Right-click** on the `formfactoreas` folder in the left sidebar
2. Select **"Add Files to 'formfactoreas'"**
3. Navigate to the `ios/formfactoreas/` folder
4. Select both files:
   - `VisionPoseDetector.swift`
   - `VisionPoseDetector.m`
5. Make sure **"Add to target: formfactoreas"** is checked
6. Click **"Add"**

### **Step 2: Verify Integration**
1. You should see both files in the project navigator
2. The files should be under the `formfactoreas` group
3. Both files should have a checkmark next to them

### **Step 3: Build and Test**
1. **Build** the project (âŒ˜+B)
2. **Run** the app (âŒ˜+R)
3. Navigate to the **Scan tab**
4. You should now see **real pose detection** instead of the demo skeleton!

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Result

After adding the files and building:
- âœ… No more "Pose detection plugin not available" logs
- âœ… Real-time pose detection working
- âœ… Skeleton overlay tracking your movements
- âœ… Camera working with pose analysis

## ðŸ”§ If You See Issues

1. **Clean Build Folder**: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder (âŒ˜+Shift+K)
2. **Rebuild**: Build â†’ Build (âŒ˜+B)
3. **Check Target Membership**: Select each file and ensure "formfactoreas" target is checked

**The pose detection should work perfectly once these files are added to the Xcode project!** ðŸš€
