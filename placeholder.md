Why Form Matters
	•	Superior Muscle Growth
Performing each rep with strict technique ensures your target muscles receive the full training stimulus. No more wasted effort from compensatory movements—just straight-up hypertrophy.
	•	Built-In Injury Prevention
Proper alignment and controlled motion protect your joints and connective tissues. Our real-time feedback catches form breakdowns before they become pain or injury.
	•	Rehab & Recovery
Guided exercise form is the cornerstone of effective physical therapy. Retrain faulty movement patterns, restore symmetry, and reduce risk of re-injury—all with clinician-grade precision.

⸻

Science-Backed Benefits
	•	Full Range-of-Motion activation drives maximal muscle fiber recruitment.
	•	Controlled loading keeps stress on muscles, not ligaments or discs.
	•	Neuromuscular re-education corrects compensations for long-term functional gains.

HSA-Eligible Therapeutic Tracking

Because our form-factor guidance can serve a medical purpose—prescribed by your healthcare provider—it may qualify for HSA/FSA reimbursement with a Letter of Medical Necessity.
